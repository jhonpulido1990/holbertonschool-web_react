## Tasks
### 0. Basic application
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Create a basic app named  ` dashboard `  using  ` create-react-app `  in your  ` task_0 `  directory
You will need a favicon and the Holberton logo. Download them and add them to the   ` src/ `   directory under   ` dashboard/ ` 
Holberton Logo

Remove the unused files:
*  ` service-worker ` 
*  ` index.css ` 
*  ` App.test.js ` 
in  ` task_0/dashboard/src/App.js ` , create a function  ` App `  that returns:
* a header div with a class named  ` App-header `  containing the Holberton logo and a h1 with the text  ` School dashboard ` 
* a body div with a class named  ` App-body `  containing at least one paragraph with the text  ` Login to access the full dashboard ` 
* a footer div with a class named  ` App-footer `  containing at least one paragraph with the text  ` Copyright 2020 - holberton School ` 
Modify the App.css to make the project looks like the following screenshot:

### 1. Embedding expressions, functions
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Using your code from the previous task, in  ` task_1/dashboard/src/utils.js ` :
* Create a function named  ` getFullYear `  that will return the current year
* Create a function named  ` getFooterCopy ` :* It accepts one argument  ` isIndex ` (boolean). When true, the function should return  ` Holberton School ` . When false, the function should return  ` Holberton School main dashboard ` 

* Modify the footer returned in  ` task_1/dashboard/src/App.js `  to use these two functions
in  ` task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.js ` , create a Notifications element:

* It should export a function
* The function should return a  ` div `  with the class  ` Notifications ` 
* The div should contain a paragraph with the text  ` Here is the list of notifications ` 
* import the file  ` Notifications.css ` . 
in  ` task_1/dashboard/src/Notifications.css ` , style the Notifications class:
* Add a border and some padding around the  ` div ` 
Render the Notifications element:
* Modify  ` task_1/dashboard/src/index.js `  to render the new element ( ` Notifications ` ) in a  ` div `  named  ` root-notifications ` 
* Check that you can see the two elements on the browser, and using the React browser extension
Requirements:
* When running, there should not be any lint error in the console

### 8. Create a project using Webpack
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Without reusing   ` create-react-app `   or the code from the previous exercise, start a brand new npm project
Reusing what you learned during the Webpack module:
* Set up a system to output a  ` bundle.js `  file in a  ` dist `  folder
* Set up a dev server with hot reloading
* Create a  ` src `  folder that will contain your Javascript
* Set up a simple html file in the  ` dist `  folder that will import the bundle file in the  ` body `  tag.
Install and configure the various plugins to support:
* inline source map
* style loader
* css loader
* image webpack loader

### 9. Install Babel
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body * Install Babel, and in  ` task_5/dashboard/.babelrc ` , add the presets for  ` preset-env `  and  ` preset-react ` 
* Add a  ` babel-loader `  to the Webpack configuration so you can support  ` js `  and  ` jsx `  files
* Import the files that you wrote in the previous task. All the Javascript and React code should be within the  ` src `  folder
At this point, running   ` webpack-dev-server `   should correctly execute your code, and you should be able to see the dashboard like in the last task

### 10. Reorganize the files
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Let’s reorganize the files in our project:
* Every file related to the App, should be within a  ` App `  folder
* Every file related to the Notifications, should be within a  ` Notifications `  folder
* Every file related to the utils functions, should be within a  ` utils `  folder
* Every asset file should be within the  ` assets `  folder
* Set up the  ` favicon.ico `  in the  ` dist `  folder
* Webpack config file should be within a  ` config `  folder if it isn’t already

### 11. Testing
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Install Jest and Enzyme to run your test suites
move the   ` setupTests.js `   file to   ` config `   folder if you have not already
Requirements:
* Your  ` package.json `  should have the two following scripts:
```bash
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --config config/webpack.config.js",
    "test": "jest"
